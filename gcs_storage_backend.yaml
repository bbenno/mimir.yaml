# JSON either from a Google Developers Console client_credentials.json file, or
# a Google Developers service account key. Needs to be valid JSON, not a
# filesystem path. If empty, fallback to Google default logic:
# 1. A JSON file whose path is specified by the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
# environment variable. For workload identity federation, refer to
# https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/how-to#using-workload-identity-federation on
# how to generate the JSON configuration file for on-prem/non-Google cloud
# platforms.
# 2. A JSON file in a location known to the gcloud command-line tool:
# $HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json.
# 3. On Google Compute Engine it fetches credentials from the metadata server.
# CLI flag: -<prefix>.gcs.service-account
